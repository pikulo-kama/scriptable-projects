## Overview

This project includes a variety of **Scriptable** scripts and reusable modules, designed to integrate with the iOS ecosystem and perform different tasks, such as automating actions, fetching data, and manipulating iOS features.

Whether you want to streamline your daily routine, create complex workflows, or explore the capabilities of Scriptable, this repository serves as a starting point.

## Features

- **Automated scripts**: A variety of Scriptable scripts that automate daily tasks on your iPhone/iPad.
- **Reusable modules**: Common utility functions that can be imported into other scripts for ease of use.
- **iOS integration**: Scripts that interact with native iOS features, like Calendar or iCloud File System.
- **Customizable**: Modify and extend the scripts to fit your personal or professional needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use the scripts in this project, you'll need the **Scriptable** app installed on your iOS device. You can download it from the App Store:

- [Scriptable on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188)

### Installation

To set up the framework on your iOS device, you need to install the **Bootstrap Installer**. This standalone script will automatically configure your directories and download the necessary core modules.

### 1. Download the Installer

1. Navigate to the **[Latest Release](https://github.com/pikulo-kama/scriptable-projects/releases/latest)** of this repository.
2. Scroll down to the **Assets** section at the bottom of the release notes.
3. Locate the `Installer.js` binary file.
4. Open the file and **copy its entire contents**.

### 2. Create the Script in Scriptable

1. Open the **Scriptable** app on your iPhone or iPad.
2. Tap the **+** icon in the top right corner to create a new script.
3. Paste the code you copied from the release into the editor.
4. Tap on the script name at the top and rename it to `Script Installer`.
5. Tap **Done** to save.

### 3. Run and Initialize

1. Tap the play icon (▶️) to run the `Script Installer`.
2. The script will reach out to GitHub, create the required folder structure (`Modules/`, `i18n/`, `Features/`), and download the framework's core libraries.
3. Once finished, you can start using widgets you've isntalled!
